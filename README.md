# react-native-booking-app
 Reproduction of Booking.com APP in React Native (Demo Ver.)

I created this APP as one of my React Native practices. Apparently React Native cannot only fully support most functions on Booking.com, and also make it quite flexible and manageable. As it's only a practice, I have only completed the main features of the APP such as : index page, swiper banner, searchbox(including group setting menu), avatar(with carema/photo function),display area, search result, result sorting. 
As a previous designer, I would say UI restoration is perfect. Thanks also to my friend Lulu, who supported the loading animation. There are definitely a lot to finish and improve on interaction logic, which I'll try to use my spare time to finish.
