 Reproduction of Booking.com APP in React Native (Demo Ver.)

I created this APP as one of my React Native practices. Apparently React Native not only can fully support most functions on Booking.com, and also make it quite flexible and manageable. As it's only a practice, I have only completed the main features of the APP such as : 
<b>index page</b>, <b>swiper banner</b>, <b>searchbox</b>(including group setting menu), <b>avatar</b>(with carema/photo function),<b>search result</b>, <b>result sorting</b>. <br/>
As a previous designer, I would say UI restoration is nearly perfect. Thanks also to my friend Lulu, who supported very cute loading animation. There are definitely a lot to finish and improve on interaction logic, which I'll try to use my spare time to finish.</br>
To try this app, please download the fully tested android APK. Sorry for IOS users, as I haven't got IOS devices to test yet, it's better not to release it yet.<br/>
